-- ************* Guards *********************
-- Guards are like if else trees and they really work with patterns
-- ** Using guardto comment on BMI
bmiLabel :: (RealFloat a) => a -> String -- The type can't be fractional because <= 18 might be a real no.
bmiLabel bmi
    | bmi <= 18 = "Underweight" -- Bool = "..."
    | bmi <= 25 = "Normal"
    | bmi <= 30 = "Overweight"
    | otherwise = "Obese" -- otherwise just means True and is the 'default' condition
-- we can also calculate BMI directly (bmi = weight / height ^2)
bmiCalculate :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String 
bmiCalculate weight height
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 18 = "Underweight" -- ... and so on
-- Guards can also be written on the same line
maxNum :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a
maxNum a b | a > b = a | otherwise = b

-- ** We can also define and use functions as an infix with backticks
myCompare :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Ordering
a `myCompare` b
    | a > b = GT | a == b = EQ | otherwise = LT
compareExample = 12 `myCompare` 34

-- ******* 'where'
-- ** Instead of repeating the same calculation many times, we can use the where keyword like this
calculateBmi :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String 
calculateBmi weight height
    | bmi <= 18 = "Underweight"
    | bmi <= 25 = "Normal" -- and so on
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2 -- must be indented
          normal = 25 -- we can define multiple expressions under 'where' but it is giving me an error for some reason
          (skinny, fat) = (18, 30) -- we can also do pattern matching like this
        -- Here, 'bmi', 'normal', 'skinny' and 'fat' is accessible throughout the guard / function
-- ** Input firstname and lastname and return the initials
getInitials :: String -> String -> String  
getInitials firstname lastname = [f] ++ ". " ++ [l] ++ "."  
    where (f:_) = firstname  
          (l:_) = lastname    
-- ** Input a list of weight and height pairs and return a list of BMIs
calculateBmis :: (RealFloat a) => [(a, a)] -> [a]  
calculateBmis xs = [calcBmi w h | (w, h) <- xs]  
    where calcBmi weight height = weight / height ^ 2  -- we are defining a function that takes parameters 'weight' and 'height'

-- ***** 'let' <bindings> 'in' <expression>
-- As opposed to 'where' binding, 'let' bindings are local and don't span across guards. 
-- They're only accessible to the expression after the 'in' part
areaOfCylinder :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> a  
areaOfCylinder r h = 
    let sideArea = 2 * pi * r * h  
        topArea = pi * r ^2  
    in  sideArea + 2 * topArea  
-- The main difference between 'where' and 'let' is that 'let' bindings are expressions themselves, 
-- but 'where' bindings are just syntactic constructs. For example:
letExample1 = 5 * (let a = 9 in a + 1) + 2 -- This gives 52, because the let binding returns 10
-- 'let' can also be used to introduce functions in a local scope:
letExample2 = let square x = x * x in (square 5, square 3, square 2)
--  we can bind to several variables inline by separating them with semicolons
letExample3 = (let a = 100; b = 200; c = 300 in a*b*c, let foo="Hey "; bar = "there!" in foo ++ bar)   
-- we can also do pattern matchnig with 'let'
letExample4 = (let (a,b,c) = (1,2,3) in a+b+c) * 100  
-- we can also use 'let' in list comprehension
-- The names defined in 'let' of a list comprehension are visible to the output function (before the '|')
calculateBmisLet :: (RealFloat a) => [(a,a)] -> [a]
calculateBmisLet weightHeightPair = [bmi | (w,h) <- weightHeightPair, let bmi = w / h ^ 2, bmi > 10] -- we can also add another condition to the predicate
-- We can't use 'bmi' in the '(w, h) <- weightHeightPair' part because it's defined prior to the let binding.
-- We omitted the 'in' part because the visibility of the bindings is already predefined. If we used 'in' in the predicate, it will only be visible to that predicate 

-- ******** Case Expressions
--case <expression> of <pattern> -> <result>  
--                     <pattern> -> <result> ...
-- This is one way of doing this without case expressions
getHeadNoCaseExp :: [a] -> a  
getHeadNoCaseExp [] = error "No head for empty lists!"  
getHeadNoCaseExp (x:_) = x  
-- Here we are using case expressions
getHeadCaseExp :: [a] -> a  
getHeadCaseExp xs = case xs of [] -> error "No head for empty lists!"  
                               (x:_) -> x  
-- Whereas pattern matching on function parameters can only be done when defining functions,
-- case expressions can be used pretty much anywhere
describeList1 :: [a] -> String  
describeList1 xs = "The list is " ++ case xs of [] -> "empty."  
                                                [x] -> "a singleton list."
